# Grade Distribution Visualization Script

## Introduction

This Python script provides a comprehensive analysis and visualization of grade distributions across multiple courses. It reads grade data from a specified CSV file, converts letter grades to numerical grade points, and visualizes the distribution of grades for each course. For one specific course, `STATS250`, it further analyzes the distribution by overlaying a sample of grades with both normal and T-distributions. This script is an invaluable tool for educators, students, and academic researchers interested in understanding grade trends and distributions in educational data.
